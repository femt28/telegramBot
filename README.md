# Movie Picker Telegram Bot

This is a simple Telegram bot I made to make it easier to choose movies to watch

The bot has 2 main commands
1. **/choose**
    - The bot will choose from a provided list in the text message
2. **/search**
   - First, the bot will create a Google search link and send it to the user for easy searching on the internet
   - Secondly, the bot will pull data from The Movie Database and display the stats on the closest matching movie, if it finds one
  
There is also the **/start** command which greets the user
There is the **/help** command which displays the available commands and a discription
The list of commands also pop up when a '/' is typed in the text field
